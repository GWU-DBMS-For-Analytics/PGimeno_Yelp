Underground tunnels where humans were sold into slavery and prostitution. White slavery was occurring all through the underground tunnels of portland for decades.  It's very hot underground. Bring water as the tour is 1.5 hours. It's unimaginable how people survived down there until they were sold to ship captains or other men. At one point the tour guide showed us boots that were found underground. After the kidnapped men were beaten, their boots were removed and glass shards were spread all around them so that if they tried to escape, their feet would bleed. Seeing these men's boots was a reminder that most of these kidnapped men would never see their families again. I have a few pics too. In one of the pics, you'll see misty white streaks which were not underground. It's quite eerie and haunting. Also, most of the underground tunnels have been filled. There are still some remnants and rooms that have been preserved and that's where the tour will be. Do not expect to be walking down miles of tunnels. Most of the bad reviews are from people who were expecting a more vast underground tour. That's not this!</td>\n",

I first tried a creme brÃ»lÃ©e donut as it was all they had put out. It was afternoon and they had no selection of donuts left. That's unacceptable really. The creme brÃ»lÃ©e donut tasted nothing at all like creme brÃ»lÃ©e. It was flavorless and bitter. All the seats here were taken so I couldn't sit down with my friend. I don't understand how people like those donuts. But, everyone has a different taste.   \n",

I go for massage therapy for chronic pain. The office is very nice and soothing and she goes out of her way to accommodate you for an appointment. I would highly recommend authentic massage therapy. There are also other types of therapy offered by the practitioners. For those who want different therapies, the website has a whole list.   \n",

The service was excellent and my friend and I both had a great time at this restaurant. I also don't the prices were are high for their food. I feel their menu is well priced and the quality of food is delicious!   \n",

Always a nice treat at the end of a long day. And they're on Grubhub too!!!   \n",

They have yummy corned beef and cabbage egg rolls with a nice mustard sauce. Their sauce goes so well with egg rolls. They have bangers and mash which is also delicious. They have a large bar and the alcohol bottles are lined up behind the bartenders all the way to the ceiling! It was really cool to see that. There's a ladder too so the bartender can climb up and get your choice of drink. The location is perfect in the yamhill district of SW Portland. The service is quick too and every employee I encountered was very friendly!   \n",

I was moving from out of town and wasn't sure what to expect. The nurse Kendra was very nice and thorough and the allergist PA Jen was very attentive and caring. I also like that I can get an allergy shot on the same day as an appointment. That wasn't the case at my last allergy clinic. Thank you!   \n",

The one in downtown Portland is super delicious. Great variety of food and different selections of meat. They also have excellent desserts too. Their customer service is excellent as well. It's a great place to throw a party as the choices are vast. The restaurant accommodates different people's desires and food preferences. No need to worry if your friend  or family member is vegan or keto or gluten free, the table bar has many different types of food. Great place to dine. Make sure you go hungry!   \n",

It was a baker's dozen. Our cashier was so nice and accommodating and most importantly the donuts she picked were delicious! They have a great variety of donuts and have really improved, i think my favorites were the cake donut with vanilla frosting and M and M's and my other favorite was a simple vanilla frosted yeast donut. They put so much frosting on top which makes the donuts super yummy! All the donuts tasted fresh and were recently bakedI highly recommend voodoo donuts now! The service was top notch and fast, both pluses!   \n",

I've never had cake so delicious in my life. The chocolate peanut butter cake, strawberry shortcake, coconut de leche, and a hazelnut layered cake. All delicious. It's a charming bakery and you can sit in and eat too. They'll also put ice cream on your cake if you ask. If you want to order an entire cake instead of a slice you need to give them 5 days to prepare. So just a heads up. One of my favorite places in Portland.   \n",

I love their buffalo chicken roll appetizers with blue cheese and I also like their fried macaroni and cheese bites. They have pepperoni rolls which are also good, but not as good as their buffalo chicken rolls. I've yet to order their actual deep dish pizzas, but I'll update again once I've tried more on the menu.   \n",

The restaurant was not crowded when I came in the afternoon. They are generous with sour cream and guacamole and their guacamole is excellent. They also serve very big portions which I love. I ordered three cheese enchiladas and enjoyed them and the person I was dining with ordered chicken quesadillas and really liked his meal too. I would definitely go back as I enjoy the portions, quality of food, and polite service.   \n",

I remember ordering some sort of club sandwich. It was very good and the service was very nice. At the time I was staying at the governor hotel right above the restaurant. It was also the day before I got hired for the job that  I currently work today. Going back over 6 years ago. My memories of the restaurant are very fond. And I have come back there to sample their appetizers and desserts as I now live in the area and they've all been wonderful. I think it's a great restaurant to eat at in Portland.   \n",
       "18  I loved this tour. The guide was very well educated and well spoken. He had a lot of information and knowledge on the subject. It's very sad to see this history though. Underground tunnels where humans were sold into slavery and prostitution. White slavery was occurring all through the underground tunnels of portland for decades.  It's very hot underground. Bring water as the tour is 1.5 hours. It's unimaginable how people survived down there until they were sold to ship captains or other men. At one point the tour guide showed us boots that were found underground. After the kidnapped men were beaten, their boots were removed and glass shards were spread all around them so that if they tried to escape, their feet would bleed. Seeing these men's boots was a reminder that most of these kidnapped men would never see their families again. I have a few pics too. In one of the pics, you'll see misty white streaks which were not underground. It's quite eerie and haunting. Also, most of the underground tunnels have been filled. There are still some remnants and rooms that have been preserved and that's where the tour will be. Do not expect to be walking down miles of tunnels. Most of the bad reviews are from people who were expecting a more vast underground tour. That's not this!   \n",

My favorite item is the nova lox sandwich on an everything bagel. It always tastes fresh and they give a nice portion of cream cheese and lox. They add tomato capers and red onion to the sandwich as well which gives a cool, fresh feel. This sandwich in particular also comes with a quarter pickle and chips as well. I find it to be a good deal.   \n",

As an Italian American hailing originally from New York I'm very picky with my Italian food. I love everything I've eaten here so far. This is as close as I can get to my favorite Italian restaurants in New York.   \n",

I love the mini chocolate chip muffins. So sweet, and soft texture. Their bagels are fresh and delicious. I loved their blt, and turkey club. They also  have really tasty and crunchy pickles to go with your sandwich of choice. I think the only thing i wish for is that theiir hours were longer. Currently they close at 3pm.   \n",

Theo was the rep who helped me and was very nice when explaining things and had a good attitude. I also like that apple has classes you can take to become better educated on your product. All very helpful. The store is also in a great location right in downtown Portland.   \n",

Comfort food at its finest. Excellent customer service. I didn't eat one thing I disliked. Their baked bread and biscuit they bring to each table were awesome. Everything felt and tasted so home made. It was like having a hearty holiday meal except, you can go here whenever you please! The apple crisp dessert was also awesome. Just make sure you make reservations. Every table was taken and it will be a very long wait with no reservations.   \n",

Great ice creams! I've ordered them a few times on grub hub and have thoroughly enjoyed the different quarts of ice cream flavors they have. I've yet to try their shakes and crepes but I'm sure they are just as delicious as their ice cream quarts.   \n",

I love their crispy rolls. Very unique types of rolls and a cool menu to fill out and hand back to the server. The menu items were quite vast and had a great amount of different selections. You can also order platters for pick up to-go. Very convenient for when you want a night in with some good sushi.   \n",
